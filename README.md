# Construction Bill of Materials Bugfix Starter Kit

## Introduction

This is a skeleton project structure which will help you start solving the problem right away.

The existing implementation contains bugs that cause incorrect construction cost calculations. Your task is to investigate the codebase, identify the root causes, and fix the implementation so that the total construction cost is calculated correctly.

You may modify the existing implementation as required, but **do not modify `App/Program.cs`**, as it contains the driver code.

## Tools available to you

* .NET 8 SDK
* xUnit - Unit testing framework to help you write and run unit tests.

## Structure

* **`App/Program.cs`** contains the driver code. **Do not modify this file.**
* **`App/HouseEstimator.cs`** contains the main implementation and domain models.
* **`App.Tests/`** is where all your unit test files should be written.

A typical project structure looks like:

```text
csharp-construction-bom-bugfix-starter-kit/
├── App.sln
├── App/
│   ├── App.csproj
│   ├── Program.cs
│   └── HouseEstimator.cs
├── App.Tests/
│   ├── App.Tests.csproj
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## How to run unit tests

We have already configured the project to get started with writing and running unit tests.

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet test
```

To run tests with more detailed output:

```bash
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

All test classes should be placed in the `App.Tests` project and use xUnit's `[Fact]` or `[Theory]` attributes.

For example:

```text
HouseEstimatorTests.cs
ComponentTests.cs
```

## How to run your solution

The driver program accepts commands as command-line arguments.

For example:

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "ADD_COMPONENT Wall 1" "TOTAL_COST"
```

This should produce:

```text
Total Construction Cost: 250
```

You can pass multiple commands as separate command-line arguments:

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "ADD_COMPONENT Wall 1" "ADD_COMPONENT Roof 1" "TOTAL_COST"
```

## Checking for correctness

You can click on the **Test My Code** button from the interview application, which will run your solution against preconfigured inputs and show the output.

You can also run the program locally with custom inputs using:

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "<input 1>" "<input 2>"
```

Each complete command should be wrapped in quotes.

For example:

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "ADD_COMPONENT Wall 1" "TOTAL_COST"
```

## Sample inputs

### Wall

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "ADD_COMPONENT Wall 1" "TOTAL_COST"
```

Expected output:

```text
Total Construction Cost: 250
```

### Roof

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "ADD_COMPONENT Roof 1" "TOTAL_COST"
```

Expected output:

```text
Total Construction Cost: 380
```

### Wall + Roof

```bash
dotnet run --project App -- "ADD_COMPONENT Wall 1" "ADD_COMPONENT Roof 1" "TOTAL_COST"
```

Expected output:

```text
Total Construction Cost: 630
```

## Commands available

### `ADD_COMPONENT`

Adds a construction component.

Format:

```text
ADD_COMPONENT <Component Type> <Count>
```

Supported component types:

* `Wall`
* `Roof`
* `Floor`

Example:

```text
ADD_COMPONENT Wall 2
```

### `TOTAL_COST`

Calculates and displays the total estimated construction cost of all components added so far.

Format:

```text
TOTAL_COST
```

Example output:

```text
Total Construction Cost: 500
```

## Notes

* The existing code intentionally contains bugs.
* Investigate the existing implementation before making changes.
* Fix the root causes rather than hardcoding expected outputs.
* Existing behavior that is already correct should continue to work after your changes.
* `App/Program.cs` contains the driver code and should not be modified.
* You are encouraged to add unit tests to verify the behavior of individual components and the overall cost calculation.
